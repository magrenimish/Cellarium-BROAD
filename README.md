This repository contains:
1. My solution proposal paper titled _NEU_Cellarium_Challenge_Nimish.pdf_ for the [NEU Cellarium Challenge](https://github.com/cellarium-ai/cellarium-neu-challenge).</br>
In this paper, I presents a novel methodology for aggregating and rank-
ing nearest neighbors in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by
integrating gene expression similarity measures with cell type hierarchical
information. The approach leverages the distances provided by a nearest
neighbor search engine, adjusted by a hierarchical component to reflect
the biological relevance of cell type relationships, aiming to enhance the
interpretability and biological significance of the results.
2. An IPython notebook that contains the python implementation of Data Exploration and of each stage of my solution algorithm with detailed comments. (_Cellarium_Broad_Challenge.ipynb_)
3. A Detailed Survey of Ontology-Based Single-Cell RNA Annotation Methods (_Cellarium_Ontology_Research_Review.pdf_)
